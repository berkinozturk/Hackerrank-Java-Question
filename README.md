# Java Algorithm Challenge - 50 Days

Welcome to my 50-day Java algorithm challenge! ðŸš€

## Overview

In this repository, I'll be tackling a Java algorithmic problem every day for 50 days. The aim is to enhance my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and proficiency in Java programming.

## Folder Structure

- `Questions`: Contains questions as images.
- `Solutions`: Contains solutions as .java file.
  
## Goals

- Solve one algorithmic problem per day using Java.
- Provide clear solutions with questions.
- Optimize solutions for efficiency where possible.
- Track progress and improvements in problem-solving skills.

## Progress

You can check the number of the day from the last commit.

## Last But Not Least

I'm excited to embark on this 50-day journey of Java algorithm challenges. Follow along with my progress and feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.

**Happy coding!** ðŸŒŸ
